#summary MonolithAndroid project details

= Development Environment =
The code is currently developed using Eclipse with the ADT plugin. The current Android SDK used is m5-rc15. The development machine is an Intel Q6600 @2.4GHz with 8Gig of RAM that I put together lately, running Windows Vista Ultimate Edition.

= Problems =

  # Emulator speed. The emulator speed (Especially when using OpenGL/ES) is slow. 
  # Sound problems. Sound emulation is not mature. Sound presents a lot of pauses and hiccups especially under windows Vista, and it takes some time to start and stop audio playback.
  # SDK documentation is incomplete. Some areas of the API are not covered with examples and useful function reference. For example javax.sound.sampled package is not documented in detail. I hope that this will change when the first actual devices emerge.

= Planned Features =
To be available

= Other Tools =

The game is being developed using Open Source Tools. Graphics and bitmaps are created using the GIMP paint program. Music is created using Audacity and OpenMPT tracker. Demo videos are created using CamStudio.

= Media =

The game uses images from Wikipedia. The soundtrack is a song I recorded back in 2003. It is a drum track with a few guitar tracks layered on top of each other. The guitars are played by me.
