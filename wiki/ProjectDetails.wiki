#summary MonolithAndroid project details

= Development Environment =
The code is currently developed using Eclipse with the ADT plugin. The current Android SDK used is m3-rc37a. The development machine is a Fujitsu Siemens Amilo M 1437 -p @2.13 GHz with 1Gig of RAM, running Windows XP Home Edition.

= Problems =

# Emulator speed. The emulator speed (Especially when using OpenGL/ES) is very slow. So development of responsive applications like games becomes very difficult.
# Sound problems. Sound emulation is not mature. Sound presents a lot of pauses and hiccups, and it takes some time to start and stop audio playback. This problem is probably related to the emulator speed problems.
# SDK documentation is incomplete. Some areas of the API are not covered with examples and useful function reference. For example javax.sound.sampled package is not documented in detail. I hope that this will change when the first actual devices emerge.

= Planned Features =

= Other Tools =
