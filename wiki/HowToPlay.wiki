MonolithAndroid at present provides two modes of gameplay. "Classic" and "Monolith"


= Details =
*Classic Mode*
"Classic" mode is a plain old Tetris game which most folks love to play. You move the falling blocks left and right with the D-Pad of your Android phone. You rotate the blocks if you press up on the D-Pad and you can make a block fall faster if you press down on the D-Pad. Plain and simple. As you complete more lines the game gets faster. That's all folks.

*Monolith Mode*
"Monolith" mode at first looks like a tetris game but there are special monolith blocks (which are colored black). When a line is completed with a monolith block in it, evolution of the grid begins. The grid changes according to the rules of Conway's Game of Life. The evolution of the cells takes place for the number of timesteps labeled as energy in the game. Energy is increased every time a line is cleared.
